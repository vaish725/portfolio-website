Enhanced YOLOv5 architecture for aquatic species identification, achieving 93% detection accuracy across multiple species. Implemented efficient edge deployment optimizations for Raspberry Pi and created robust data pipelines for multi-modal input processing (image/video). Published research in the International Conference on Intelligent Systems, Data Science and Cyber Security [ICIDC-2022], demonstrating practical applications through web and mobile integration.
