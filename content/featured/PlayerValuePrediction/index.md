Developed machine learning models (Random Forest Regressor RÂ²>0.80, RF Classifier AUC>0.80) for football player value and injury risk prediction. Created a full data science pipeline from collection and preprocessing to model training and validation. Deployed an interactive Streamlit dashboard allowing sports analytics teams to make data-driven decisions on player acquisitions and management.
